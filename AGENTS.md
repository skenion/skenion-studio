# Codex Agent Context

This repository is one part of the Skenion workspace. Do not treat local code
momentum as the source of truth: before committing, pushing, opening a PR, or
writing PR close keywords, check the relevant GitHub milestone and issue with
`/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`.

Use the bundled Codex pnpm when needed:
`/Users/state303/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/bin/pnpm`.
For dependency rebuilds in this non-interactive environment, `CI=true` and
`PNPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_BUILDS=true` may be required.

## Strict v0 Studio Policy

Skenion v0 does not support legacy, deprecated, or import-only compatibility
paths. Studio authoring, Runtime HTTP clients, clipboard formats, collaboration
operations, package UX, and extension UX must model the current product surface
only. Unsupported schema, protocol, graph, project, package, manifest, or ABI
versions must be rejected with structured diagnostics rather than migrated,
imported, shimmed, or kept behind deprecated aliases.

The forward graph/project contract label is `0.1`. Studio should follow
Contracts the current 0.1 Contracts surface. Do not preserve the old v0.1
meaning as legacy compatibility, and do not keep v0.2 as a parallel Studio
surface. If a version field remains, Studio should accept only exact current
`0.1` for that surface and reject all others.

Studio should consume generated/exported contracts rather than maintaining
hand-written duplicate Runtime response shapes.

## Product Direction

Studio remains a web React/Vite client, and the desktop product uses Tauri.
Do not add Electron fallback work to v0 planning. Tauri coordinates windows,
webviews, sidecar lifecycle, connection profiles, and app-level clipboard
bridges; Runtime sessions remain authoritative for shared graph documents.

Copy/paste is a graph-editor primitive for every persisted node family,
including built-ins, extension nodes, subpatches, IO convenience nodes, and
living-help/example patches.

## Lockstep Release Train

Skenion releasable packages and applications use lockstep product SemVer during
v0. If the product train is `0.55`, Studio web/desktop artifacts publish as
`0.55.0` where tooling requires patch SemVer, and Runtime/contracts/sdk/docs
artifacts must belong to that same train. Do not create an independent Studio
version stream. Release artifacts must be produced through GitHub Actions and
Release Please, not local publishing.

## Manager, Worker, And Review Gate Defaults

Codex should operate as a manager/orchestrator on Skenion work. The manager owns
sequencing, milestone and issue hygiene, PR title/body/close-keyword control,
worker assignment, integration, and final reporting. Except for trivial
documentation, context, issue, or status edits, the manager should not directly
modify code. Implementation work and follow-up fixes should be delegated to
focused worker agents, then integrated by the manager. Workers must receive a
clear ownership scope, usually specific files, modules, or repository slices,
and must be told that other agents may be editing nearby code.

Follow-up work is not an exception: if review, CI, or user feedback requires
non-trivial code changes, the manager must assign that work to a worker and send
the completed slice through a separate review gate again. The manager may run
verification and status commands, but should not directly patch non-trivial
implementation code.

Every completed worker slice needs a separate review gate before it is treated
as done. The gate should be a different expert agent from the worker. A gate
review should prioritize correctness, API cleanliness, responsibility
boundaries, readability, test coverage, CI risk, and milestone acceptance
criteria. If the gate fails, the manager must send concrete fixes back to a
worker, then run the gate again until the slice passes or a real blocker is
recorded in the issue. The manager may only make trivial documentation,
context, issue, or status corrections directly.

Default code quality requirements:

- Write code that is easy to read before it is clever.
- Follow clean-code principles: clear names, small responsibilities, explicit
  data flow, predictable control flow, and low incidental coupling.
- Do not introduce interface-based abstraction lightly. Public APIs, traits,
  generated clients, schemas, and extension points must earn their existence and
  remain small, stable, and understandable.
- Keep responsibility ownership clear. Runtime, Studio, Contracts, SDK,
  Examples, and Docs must not duplicate each other's source-of-truth roles.
- UI/UX work must be reviewed for actual workflow quality, not merely rendered
  components.

Issues and milestones are the operating ledger. When work discovers new debt,
missing scope, or a design risk, record it on the relevant GitHub issue or open
a properly milestoned issue before burying it in local context. Close issues
only when the repository-specific acceptance criteria are genuinely complete.
Use `Refs` for partial or cross-repo work and `Closes` only for finished scope.
